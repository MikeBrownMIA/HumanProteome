# Protein Size Search Engine for Human Proteome

### Code can be run from command line using Python 3 to find the estimated size (in kDa) of any protein of interest in the human proteome. 
### Human proteome fasta file accessed from https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640
### Full or partial protein names, or genes symbols can be used to search.
### Search redundancy returns a list of proteins and their sizes that included the search criteria in their name.
### Estimated molecular weight calculated by number of amino acids times average weight of one amino acid residue (110 Da).
### Also returns number of search hits for search criteria.
